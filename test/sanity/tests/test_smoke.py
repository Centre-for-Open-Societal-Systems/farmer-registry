# Liveness + wiring for the Farmer Registry partner-api (the PEP). No auth, no
# data created — runs on every install/upgrade.
#
# Overlays the platform suite's test_smoke.py: the rc.557 partner-api serves the
# DCI search as /dci/sync/search and /dci/async/search, while the platform's
# copy of this test still looks for the retired /dci/registry prefix and fails
# every install. The assertion below names the routes the API actually has.
